Print production and costs will be managed separately by the ACIAR Outreach Team and are not in scope for this tender.The second deliverable will be content (text, graphics and images) for publishing on the ACIAR website, consisting of an online mockup for three pages (home/entry page, table of contents page and content page). Web development costs will be managed separately by the ACIAR Outreach Team and are not in scope for this tender.Specifically, the service provider will:Meet with ACIAR to discuss the overarching style, tone and content for the 40-year publication, including proposed content and sources of information.Produce and present to ACIAR an options paper of no more than 16 pages on the style, content, level of detail and mix of written and visual information for the ACIAR 40-year publication. The paper must include examples of similar publications from other organisations, for consideration by ACIAR. From the options paper ACIAR will determine the format of the 40-year publication and convey this to the service provider. The paper will be due no later four weeks following the signing of the contract.Following ACIAR directions on the options paper, develop a detailed flat plan for a 100 page (including cover) A4 publication that details the content, including a foreword, table of contents and other preliminary pages, an introduction, articles/editorial, case studies, , index, photographs, infographics and any other content. This should include as much detail as possible on the chapters of the book, subjects/themes of articles, interviews and case studies, noting that the research stage will uncover additional information and ideas that can be incorporated at later stages.On approval of the flat plan from ACIAR, develop a workplan of no more than three -pages, including timeline, for production and final delivery stages for the print ready and digital versions.Following written approval from ACIAR on the flat plan and workplan, conduct research on ACIAR history, projects and achievements from a range of source materials including past issues of Partners Magazine, published reports including impact assessments, source and conduct interviews with past and present staff and project partners in Australia and overseas (noting ACIAR may be able to provide contact information for some, but others will need investigation) and other key stakeholders including Crawford Fund past and present members.From the research phase, draft all content, and fact check with, and seek written approval from, sources. Ensure the writing style and use of English is consistent with the ACIAR style guide.

The Terms and Conditions and the Notes for Medical Grade Footwear Suppliers) will be included on DVA’s list of contracted MGF suppliers.

This is a simplified contracting model that DVA is using to facilitate engagement with suitably qualified providers.   A summary of the key features of the new arrangements are: maximising the numbers of participating providers to achieve wide access to private hospitals services for the veteran community;there is no competition, all qualified providers can participate;while providers are required to submit the fee tables, there is no requirement for tender submission or evaluation of tenders;providers self-certify their compliance with DVA’s terms and conditions of the Hospital Services Agreement; providers can enter into the Hospital Services Agreement at any time and the Hospital Services Agreement will continue until DVA ends the arrangements or the Contracting Entity exits the arrangements with DVA; andnegotiation only on fees to ensure value for money.",

The information received by the Commonwealth from the Market Sounding may be used to help identify potential Early Works Contractors who may then be invited to make submissions as part of a Limited Tender for the Early Works.  The Early Works will likely be delivered first by one or more Minor or Medium Works Contractors and will likely include the following: (i)            Survey (ii)           Demolition works (removing redundant infrastructure - internal fences, buildings, sheds, dams, bores and the like); (iii)          Contamination remediation works (removing rubbish tips, septic systems, asbestos, Petroleum, Oil & Lubricants (POL)); (iv)          Tree clearance works (for fire breaks, or minor site clearance); (v)           Range control facility; (vi)          Fencing works (cattle style fencing: new and repairing existing);  (vii)         Minor track construction / repairs works; and (viii)        Relocation of services (power, water, sewer). This Market Sounding will ONLY apply to the Early Works described above.",

Once complete, the project will deliver a 78 kilometre non-stop motorway connecting the northern and southern suburbs and provide a vital strategic link for motorists and the freight transport industry. The final stage is the most complex, requiring the delivery of over $5 billion in infrastructure works.When complete, this Corridor will provide a series of strategic, free-flowing road links to connect the rapidly expanding industrial and residential growth areas in the north and south, unlocking new opportunities for economic development, reducing commute times, increasing productivity, improving safety, enabling inner city urban redevelopment, growing land values and protecting Adelaide’s liveability.Ground investigations are being undertaken over multiple phases to undertake all of the required geotechnical, contamination and hydrogeological site investigations along the North-South Corridor Program (River Torrens to Darlington). Phase 1 Ground investigations are currently being undertaken by T2D Geoventure (Contract 20C202). The Department seeks to engage a service provider to undertake Phase 2 which will build on the findings of the Phase 1 scope. There will be additional future investigation phases which will be procured and scoped separately following development of the Reference Design.The NSC T2D Phase 2 Ground Investigations will be primarily focused within the Southern area of the proposed NSC T2D route from Anzac Hwy through to Darlington.The Phase 1 Ground Investigations are focussed on providing a very broad understanding of the geotechnical, hydrogeological and contamination conditions over the entire NSC T2D Project area. Information and findings to date regarding the Phase 1 works will be included in the Phase 2 tender appendices to provide all bidders with consistent information to inform their proposals.The Department is continuing to progress the Reference Design against the recently endorsed the Hybrid+ option. The Phase 2 Ground Investigations are required to provide a more accurate understanding of the geotechnical, hydrogeological and contamination conditions along the Stage 1 (Anzac Highway to Tonsley Boulevard) section of the proposed Hybrid + route. This information will help to inform and aid in decisions for the Reference Design and provide for more accurate estimates for geotechnical and hydrogeological ground conditions and levels of contamination for waste materials. Stage 1 has been highlighted as the priority area based on anticipated program delivery staging.The professional services provider will be required to do all work needed to complete the investigation over a 10 month period from contract commencement.To respond to this RFT, Proponents must meet minimum requirements including but not limited to prequalification under the Professional and Technical Services Prequalification Panel, 17C811.Where a Proponent comprises more than one party, it is not necessary for each individual party to be prequalified in respect of both geotechnical and hydrogeological services; those pre-qualifications may be held by separate members of the Proponent entity.  Where a Proponent is only pre-qualified in one category the Proponent must provide supporting bid information to confirm their capability and capacity to deliver all the requirements of this tender. TENDER RESPONSE UPLOADShould you require assistance in uploading your tender submission electronically please contact the Tenders SA helpdesk on (08) 8462 1401.

As the Tribunal concludes the remaining historical inquiries and begins to consider contemporary kaupapa claims, the specialist support needs are changing and it is timely to review the panel. The support required by the Tribunal includes contracted specialised technical services for the following reasons: •\tInquiry research topics vary greatly and can often be particularly complex. The Tribunal Unit contracts specialists with expertise in particular fields such as environmental history, public works, Māori land law and land administration, Māori studies and demography;•\tDemand for researchers and report writers fluctuates as inquiries move into and out of the research phase; and•\tThe Waitangi Tribunal holds around 80 days of hearings per year, the majority of which occur in the claimants’ tribal area and often on marae. Tribunal hearings usually require simultaneous interpreters and sound technicians. We are  issuing this open standing invitation to seek applications from prospective suppliers (either organisations or individuals), who are able to demonstrate the skills, knowledge and experience required in providing one or more of the services, in order to join the panel. Questions and applications are welcomed at any time during the publication of this invitation.

    "description": "PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT RESPONSES OR QUESTIONS THROUGH GETS FOR THIS OPEN STANDING INVITATION.The Waitangi Tribunal was established under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 as a permanent Commission of Inquiry, charged with making recommendations on claims brought by Māori in relation to actions or omissions of the Crown that breach the promises made in the Treaty of Waitangi.The Waitangi Tribunal Unit provides support to the Tribunal across all phases of inquiries from the initial assessment and registration of claims; through to the conduct of research; inquiry proceedings; and the final report writing phase. As the Tribunal concludes the remaining historical inquiries and begins to consider contemporary kaupapa claims, the specialist support needs are changing and it is timely to review the panel. The support required by the Tribunal includes contracted specialised technical services for the following reasons: •\tInquiry research topics vary greatly and can often be particularly complex. The Tribunal Unit contracts specialists with expertise in particular fields such as environmental history, public works, Māori land law and land administration, Māori studies and demography;•\tDemand for researchers and report writers fluctuates as inquiries move into and out of the research phase; and•\tThe Waitangi Tribunal holds around 80 days of hearings per year, the majority of which occur in the claimants’ tribal area and often on marae. Tribunal hearings usually require simultaneous interpreters and sound technicians. We are  issuing this open standing invitation to seek applications from prospective suppliers (either organisations or individuals), who are able to demonstrate the skills, knowledge and experience required in providing one or more of the services, in order to join the panel. Questions and applications are welcomed at any time during the publication of this invitation. The initial round of responses will be evaluated on 14 August 2018 and thereafter conducted upon receipt of a proposal.  The open standing invitation will run until the 31st August 2021. Approval to extend this date may be sought if there is still a requirement for the panel after this date.Please contact James Skinner via e-mail on wt.librarian@justice.govt.nz for evaluation documentation or for further information.PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY QUESTIONS SUBMITTED THROUGH GETS WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.",

The rate is around 0.7 deaths per 1,000 babies born. Most of these deaths occur in Māori and Pacific whānau.This procurement relates to the delivery of Lakes DHB local SUDI Prevention programme. Previously this has been provided by Lakes DHB (Population Health) who delivered a range of activities including: Hapū wānanga, weaving wānanga, distribution of safe sleep devices and contributed to the Midlands Regional approach, with Waikato, Taranaki, Bay of Plenty and Tairawhiti DHBs. Hapū wānanga have been running for over two years and have been positively received by those who attend. Going forward we want to continue the provision of hapū wānanga, but believe that this would be best moved to a community-based Māori provider to deliver a service/programme that reaches and engages with our priority population and addresses the known SUDI risk factors, in particular smoking and risky sleeping environments.Supplier breifing will be held 16th February.

Nematodes are a common pest found in association with germplasm material, such as whole plants, rooted cuttings and bulbs. Plant parasitic nematodes, such as potato cyst, beet cyst, root lesion and root-knot nematodes, parasitize plants reducing their growth and survival, resulting in significant crop yield losses. The current treatment for nematodes intercepted at the New Zealand border is a combination of methyl bromide/hot water and treatment with the active ingredient fenamiphos. Use of fenamiphos is being phased out in New Zealand by 1 July 2023 due to a decision made by the New Zealand Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). In order to manage the risk of nematodes in the nursery stock pathway, Biosecurity New Zealand must find an alternative active ingredient treatment to fenamiphos. This treatment method must be acceptable for use within New Zealand’s regulatory framework that manages the use of agricultural chemicals in the country – Agricultural Compound and Veterinary Medicine (ACVM) and EPA controls.PLEASE NOTE: To be provided the additional documentation for this RFP, you must complete and sign the Confidentiality Agreement and send to Amy McNabb, Procurement Specialist at amy.mcnabb@mpi.govt.nz",

    "blurb": "",
    "description": "Commercial Fishing Base No.2 (CFB2) is located on Chinaman Creek near the Maritime Safety Queensland base. Road access is via CFB2 Access Road off Tingira Street, Portsmith, Cairns, QLD.The wharf forming CFB2 was constructed in the late 1980’s and primarily consists of a steel substructure with a pre cast concrete deck. The original water main was constructed from 100mm galvanised steel and protected with densowrapping. The reticulation forms a ring main, approximately 300lm, around the outer edge of the concrete deck. Painted steel brackets attached by bolts through the deck are utilised to fix the pipe work to the wharf. The position of this water main renders it vulnerable to impact damage from fishing vessels and over time there have been many sections of pipe and brackets physically deformed. Significant water main failures commenced from 2012 when the asset was around 25 years old. Over a 4 year period approximately 100m of the galvanised pipe was replaced but not protected with denso wrap and some sections are already showing signs of significant surface corrosion. Of the remaining 200m approximately 50m is damaged. The remainder is difficult to assess by visual inspection only but the denso wrapping is damaged so not providing a reliable corrosion barrier and there are spots with isolated leaks. Given the age of the original galvanised main is reaching 35 years, within a corrosive marine environment, the risk of continual leaks caused by pitting in the near future is high. Since 2012 this water asset has cost the Port $40K to maintain. Therefore, more sustainable water supply options will be considered for the future of CFB2. A fire system is not required on CFB2 so nonmetallic options such as polyethylene can be utilised. Ports North are open to consider any sustainable options with whole of life cost benefits. The benefits of installing a polyethylene water main suspended centrally under the deck next to the electrical cable ladder include; Halving the linear distance of the main line Eliminating the risk of vessel impact damage Clearing services away from the steel girders which will significantly reduce future blast and paint maintenance costs Eliminate corrosive metallic materials Increase asset life and reduced whole of life costs Simple to repair in the event of damage Lower cost than maintaining and upgrading the existing reticulation with denso wrapped galvanised steel",

Furthermore, once this research is gathered, we are seeking recommendations as to the appropriate strategic response.\tBackgroundThe Melbourne Wholesale Flower Market (MWFM) supplies 60% of Australia’s fresh cut flowers. At the Market there are 152 trader stands that are a mix of growers and wholesalers, of whom sell to retailers, florists, event managers and hospitality industry.MWFM relocated to a state-of-the-art facility in Epping in 2015. This saw a shift in the flower industry and the role of the MWFM.  Many growers reviewed their sales model and moved to supplying the market and selling through a distributor in the market or opened for farm gate sales. This was one of the many factors that attributed to the current downturn being experienced at the MWFM.  Other factors include:\ta shift in flower industry to move to event or online florists rather than retail stores\tincreasing costs to travel to the market\thours of operation etc.\tincreased supply of imports (not during COVID, but normally)\tculture of the market\tsupply and range\tincreasing number of wholesalers on the outskirtsCOVID has provided opportunities for the MWFM’s wholesalers and retailers who have been able to adjust and adopt throughout COVID. Some have done this by targeting lockdown customers through flower deliver or moving to buying and selling online, although overall  the with increasing costs and imports has resulted in the MWFM experiencing an overall downturn. The Melbourne Market Authority has a vested interested in boosting the Victorian Flower Industry, in particular, ensuring the MWFM remains a key component of the Victorian supply chain in whichever form that takes. The primary purpose of this research is to:\tpulse check of market users, both stand holders, buyers and past users\tgain a clear understanding of customers experience in using the market; and create a plan to make this journey a positive one\tpulse check on culture of the market and what effects this has on user experience\tmap the customer experience for accessing the market (sign up) and traditional buying experience\tchallenges for sellers in the market \tunderstand why past users are no longer using the marketThis research can be conducted by (open to recommendations); survey groups of key flower market groups e.g. growers, users, florists, advisory committees, non-users, past users and any other relevant parties.A pulse check on what the MWFM offers, ability to access, its short falls, what can be improved and changes that need to be made to enhance user experience and attendance. A consultant is sought to provide advice, recommendations and possible courses of action to address what would enhance the MWFM and enhance the experience of the cohorts that use it. The work will be completed in a number of phases:Phase 1Discussion with the Melbourne Market Authority team as an initial briefPhase 2Discussion with the Flower Market Advisory CommitteePhase 3A mixed method approach to survey wholesalers, growers and florists. (past users, non-users, education institutes)Phase 4 Identify concerns, issues within the market from key segments. Test reaction to changes.Phase 5Provide a summary report of the research and recommendations \tProject Outcomes / objectivesThe purpose of this research is to do a pulse check on the MWFM and map a plan to increase patronage and loyalty to the MWFM. This research is required to understand the culture (internal /external perspective), sense of place/ownership, challenges, reputation, understand the decline in patronage, market competition and changes required to see MWFM as the market leader.The key objectives of the project are to:\tSurvey and engage with a cross section of tenants, users, buyers and stakeholders of the Melbourne Wholesale Flower Market.\tSurvey to grasp an understanding of culture, customer service, complaints procedure, opportunities for improvement, what can be done to improve patronage and economic viability of the Flower Market/maximise its potential.\tOutcome dependent, to identify a road map / list of recommendations to achieve the MWFM full potential.1.

    "description": "The Port Phillip and Westernport Catchment Management Authority (PPWCMA) requires a new set of illustrated maps of the Port Phillip and Western Port region.The PPWCMA had an illustrated map created around 10 years ago (provided in brief and Specialisation Documents), and while this illustration is still reasonably accurate, it no longer reflects some important changes to the region, in particular the urban expansion.The PPWCMA values the style of the current map and is seeking a new version that maintains an illustrated style (incorporating the new artist’s individual style) but reflects the region’s current landscape.  The PPWCMA will consider a more contemporary feel for the map and/or a different style if that offers advantages over the current style.Initially the map(s) will be used on a new website for the Port Phillip & Western Port Regional Catchment Strategy. Beyond that, the maps will be used in various ways to promote the PPWCMA and its work.A deviation from the current illustration, which is a single map, is that the PPWCMA is seeking an additional version of the map that shows the region split into nine local areas, plus stand-alone maps/illustrations of those local areas. Final productsMaps of the Port Phillip and Western Port region presented in an illustrated format:\tMap of full region\tMap showing how region is split into 9 ‘local areas’\tIndividual maps of the 9 local areas showing more local detail.Maps files to be provided as PDF, JPG and PNG. Responding to this project briefPlease read the project brief attached.

The proposed Project is approximately ~2000 line kms (this value may change by +/- 10-15% depending on data availability and quality) comprising about 34 lines from 7 surveys of different vintages. The recording time for the surveys varies from 3s to 4s.",
    "description": "The Australian Government has provided $125 million to Geoscience Australia to continue and expand the Exploring for the Future (EFTF) program in phase 2 in Trans-Australia potential corridors, with the program designed to increase investment in minerals, energy and groundwater resources. The EFTF program has been, and will now continue to be, integral to the Australian Government’s vision ‘to have the world’s most advanced, innovative and successful resources sector that delivers sustained prosperity and social development for all Australians’. The program will also be critical in achieving our targets in Strategy 2028. As part of the newly announced extension to the Exploration for The Future (EFTF) program, Geoscience Australia is embarking on various new data acquisition programs. The “Australia’s Future Energy Resources” project will evaluate the prospectivity of selected underexplored sedimentary basins and assess their untapped resource potential of natural gas, oil, and groundwater. One of the identified priority areas is located in the greater NE South Australia/SW Northern Territory region and is partly represented by a stacked sequence of sedimentary basins including the Eromanga, Simpson, Pedirka and Warburton basins.Previous exploration carried out in the 1960s to 1990s confirmed the existence of petroleum systems, however no commercial discoveries were made. During that period several seismic surveys have been acquired by the industry which are now open file. In order to improve the understanding of hydrocarbon prospectivity and to gain a clearer picture of the geological evolution of this region it appears important to revisit the existing seismic data sets. It is anticipated that by applying state-of-the-art reprocessing techniques the currently available vintage seismic data can be dramatically enhanced to provide better imaging of the tectonic architecture and its control on the development of key sedimentary sequences and their relationship with regional unconformities. The aim is to de-risk the region for future exploration activities, and facilitate decision making for both government and industry organisations.The reprocessing of 2D vintage seismic data, as a component of the EFTF program, will produce an improved quality seismic dataset using modern processing techniques, which were unavailable at the time of the original data acquisition and initial processing, will lead to improved imaging of the subsurface, with better resolution of structural features to allow more confident interpretation of shallow structures. The new seismic reprocessed data will be available as pre-competitive information to assist industry to better target areas likely to contain the next major oil, gas and mineral deposits.Geoscience Australia seeks to contract a Seismic Processing Provider to conduct the reprocessing of legacy onshore seismic data to obtain the newly reprocessed precompetitive geoscience data. The proposed Project is approximately ~2000 line kms (this value may change by +/- 10-15% depending on data availability and quality) comprising about 34 lines from 7 surveys of different vintages. The recording time for the surveys varies from 3s to 4s.A map location with proposed line for reprocessing (Appendix 1) and available acquisition parameters are (Appendix 2).Geoscience Australia requires that the data be processed over a period of 18-22 weeks.Acquisition parameters and data quality vary between surveys. Care is needed to select optimal lines/surveys and may need some revision in collaboration with the Service Provider relative to the list supplied in Appendix 2.Geoscience Australia requires the Service Provider to undertake land seismic reprocessing of legacy 2D seismic reflection data listed in the table and provide the optimum processing flow given the acquisition parameters. The expectation is that the data quality will be improved through the application of contemporary processing methods including re-examination of the velocities, informed in turn by the geological framework of the area. QC and testing of the data at appropriate intervals will be required and included in the work program. Geoscience Australia is currently in the process of engaging a Quality control specialist to oversee the processing.We require common routines for 2D land seismic data including but not limited• Post-Stack Time Migration;• Pre-Stack Time Migration (optional alternate workflow where supported by data quality);• Depth ConversionAs per Statement of Requirement, please include a table for the Proposed Dates of Completion for different stages of processing and intermediate products. The Seismic Processing Provider Services Provider will have a demonstrated record of achievement in the planning, management and delivery of seismic data undertaken with the mineral resources or related industries. The Seismic Processing Services Provider will be able to demonstrate prior experience in working collaboratively with a diverse stakeholder base in the exploration and community sectors to deliver successful projects, and scientific and business outcomes.",

The briefing materials can be viewed here.This market sounding exercise supports the development of the preferred procurement approach for the first tranche of 90 battery electric buses and supporting infrastructure, training and skills development.A formal procurement process is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2021 and will be a separate open market tender process. For those who have already registered, you will soon be invited to complete a short questionnaire with select interviews to take place until mid to late April 2021. There is no need to re-register your interest.Its not too late to get involved. To participate in the market sounding please visit the Transport Canberra website for more information or complete and submit the registration form via the link below. About the project and market soundingsThe ACT Government has committed to an ambitious plan to transition its bus fleet tozero-emissions by 2040. The procurement of a first tranche of 90 battery electric buses kick-starts this transition while learning, upskilling and de-risking the future steps. The Zero-Emission Transition Plan for Transport Canberra can be found here.The market sounding is a genuine opportunity to receive input from all industry sectors to inform the upcoming procurement of our first tranche of 90 zero-emission buses.The market sounding is focussed on engaging a wide range of industry representatives and participants including the bus manufacturing, battery technology, energy generation and distribution, skills and service industries.The market sounding is exploring key delivery concepts and assumptions including market capacity, potential packaging, risk allocation and project specific issues such as technology, timing and scale.Transport Canberra is looking for innovative solutions that respond to the infrastructure, power, training and technology opportunities of a zero-emission fleet, and can deliver on the objectives of a sustainable, compact and efficient city. Buses may be housed and charged in a mixture of either existing depots, off-site locations or at the new Woden bus depot.The market sounding program includes a series of industry forums, interactive discussions and an information sharing platform to allow Transport Canberra to develop procurement documentation that encourages innovation and responds to industry capability. This process will conclude with interviews with relevant stakeholders.Subject to the findings of the market soundings, the procurement process will progress through either the release of a Request for Expression of Interest or direct progression to Request for Proposal depending on which is deemed the most efficient and appropriate for this procurement activity.",

    "description": "The Mount Buffalo Chalet is located on Mount Buffalo, in the Alpine region of north-eastern Victoria, accessed via a sealed road within the Mount Buffalo National Park. The Mount Buffalo Chalet Main Building, constructed in 1912 and extended in the 1920s and 1930s, ranges from 2-3 storeys with a floor area of approximately 6,000m2. It is a s very substantial timber-frame, timber weatherboard-lined building with a corrugated metal roof. It is subject to harsh and exposed alpine conditions including substantial annual snowfall.The Mount Buffalo Chalet is of architectural, historical and social significance to the State of Victoria. The Mount Buffalo Chalet is included on the Victorian Heritage Register (H0901), regulated through the Heritage Act (2017). The extent of registration includes everything located within the identified parcel of land, including multiple buildings and structures, and gardens and landscaping features.The Chalet is of architectural significance as one of the largest alpine resort complexes in Victoria and is of historical significance for its association with the history of leisure in Victoria and the development of the Mount Buffalo National Park. It is of social significance due to its association with a section of the community in their pursuit of recreation and the development of the Mount Buffalo National Park as a year-round alpine resort for a broad cross section of the community.Mt Buffalo Chalet is included on the National Heritage List as part of Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves, regulated through the Environment Protection & Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth.).The on-going conservation and management of the Chalet within its harsh alpine location requires an effective, disciplined approach as part of the broader management of the Place.The aim of the project is to provide for a wind and water-tight external building envelope, to arrest deterioration and stabilise the Chalet such that future repair/maintenance to the exterior is reqular, routine and programmed to suit available funding/resources.This project will bring forward essential repairs and maintenance to the balance of the building envelope of the Chalet that would otherwise require up to a ten-year cycle of internal Parks Victoria funding.The project will reconcile best practice or industry-standard conservation techniques with the Alpine, bushfire prone remote location of the Chalet across a range of typical repair and maintenance practices to fabric that comprises the external envelope. The project will support repairs consistent with the conservation policies of the Heritage Action Plan.The project **excludes** any restoration program for the interiors. The project does not include work on essential services such as fire services, which are currently well maintained.=====================================================================================================Revision1_ 4 attachments added on 26/03\tPurcell Architecture (see drawings) - EXTERNAL ELEVATIONS CONSERVATION WORKS MARK-UP\tMount Buffalo Chalet, Maintenance Management Plan, External Building Envelope (Purcell, 2020)\tHeritage Action Plan (Allom Lovell 2002)\tUpdated window repair report (Purcell 2020).Revision 2 _ 4 floorplan pdf + Q&A added on 08/04",

    "blurb": "",
    "description": "The Principal invites the Tenderer to submit a Tender for the delivery of dredging services under the Lower Yarra River Maintenance Dredging Program including at sites centred around fixed and floating landings, wharfs, floating pontoons, and the main navigational channel. The Services are for two (2) fixed dredging campaigns – the Campaign A Services and the Campaign B Services which each have fixed commencement and completion dates.  The Principal has the sole discretion to award further tranches of the Services, namely the Campaign C Services and Further Services. The Sites relevant to the Campaign C Services and Further Services have not yet been determined and amongst other things will be subject to priorities at the time, the rate of siltation of previous Sites and budget availability.  If directed, the Campaign C Services and Further Services will also have fixed commencement and completion dates.Parks Victoria is seeking responses from experienced operators who can provide dredging expertise that results in efficiencies, innovation and cost benefits over the course of the Contract.Parks Victoria is the waterway manager for the Yarra River (under the Marine Safety Act 2010 (Vic)) and is responsible for ensuring safe navigation. Parks Victoria manages several fixed and floating landings as well as the navigational channel of the lower Yarra River. The gradual accretion of silt and sediment has led to a reduction in channel width and depth for some parts of the river resulting in restricted safe navigational access to facilities.The Victorian Government has provided funding to improve commercial and recreational access along the Lower Yarra River through dredging.  This represents the biggest investment into the Yarra River since the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The funding boost means that the precinct will be maintained as a prominent landmark in Melbourne CBD and acknowledges its contribution to the modern culture and social vibrancy of Melbourne.The aim of the Lower Yarra River Maintenance Dredging Program is to reinstate sufficient water depth at prioritised areas in a manner that minimises disturbance to stakeholders, is consistent with Government guidance and policy and is conducted in a safe and environmentally sustainable manner. Dredging sites are centred around fixed and floating landings as well as the navigational channel.  The Services will entail dredging at an estimated 4-6 dredging sites per year. As a general indication, each dredge campaign will be undertaken over an estimated period of 4-9 months, removing around an estimated volume of 8 000m3 per dredge campaign.  The required pumping distance for disposal ranges between 300-3,500m depending on the dredging site. The project area for the Lower Yarra River Maintenance Dredging Program extends between the Bolte Bridge and Burnley Harbour.The nature of the Services and project constraints suggest the program is suited to small dredging equipment such as a small cutter suction dredger (CSD) or equivalent due to the restricted accessibility to the Sites given low bridge height clearance and the small dredging areas and volumes per dredging site. The dredged material is to be deposited in designated disposal sites in deeper parts of the river.The environmental requirements for dredging must comply with:\tthe Addendum C - Lower Yarra Maintenance Dredging: Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) developed for the maintenance dredging program;\tthe Best Practice Environmental Management:  Guidelines for Dredging (BPEMG) (EPA 2001); and\tthe National Assessment Guidelines for Dredging (NAGD) (Commonwealth of Australia 2009).The dredging services under the Lower Yarra River Maintenance Dredging Program will be carried out in accordance to Addendum A - Services Specification, Addendum B - Lower Yarra Maintenance Dredging Design – Specification and Addendum C - Lower Yarra Maintenance Dredging: EMMP. Close date for all questions is COB 28 April 2021.",

The role of the intermediary is to:\tassess witness communication and describe any specific communication assistance required;\tprovide practical strategies on how to best communicate with the witness and how to pose a question to get the most reliable evidence;\tinform directions hearings, where applicable, to establish court communication guidelines for a vulnerable witness; and\twrite court reports on an individual’s communication needs.The scheme will operate as a two-year pilot in two locations (Brisbane and Cairns), with anticipated commencement in July 2021. This invitation is for Cairns services only. The scheme applies to any child sexual offence prosecution witness who:\tIs under 16 years, or\tIs a person with an impairment of the mind, or\tHas difficulty communicating.Intermediaries can be engaged from police investigation through to court hearing. They will be required to act in emotionally challenging cases involving child sexual offences and will be exposed to detailed information about child sexual offences.Given the potentially distressing nature of cases requiring an intermediary, potential candidates who have serious reservations about being involved in such cases should consider whether to apply.Intermediaries may be asked to assess, and sometimes attend an interview with, a witness at short notice.  Panel members will be required to be flexible and organised in order to meet these time commitments.  Some evening and weekend work may be required.Further information can be obtained by downloading the material listed in section 3",

This analysis will consider whether the current governing standards in Australia will adequately safeguard against potential emerging issues, and if not, what strategic interventions can be made.

This Registration of Interest (ROI) is an invitation to suitably qualified respondents to register an interest for the Ministry of Health (the Ministry) procurement to improve abortion service access and address inequity for Māori and other priority populations (including Pacific, and Disabled People) who are disproportionately impacted by current abortion service barriers.The intention of the abortion legislation (2020) was to remove barriers to abortion service access and enable earlier access to abortion. We know earlier access provides patients more time to consider their options, more choice of abortion procedure and more opportunity to have their abortion at home, or closer to home, rather than being required to travel to a hospital-based specialist service. Earlier abortion (within the first trimester) may also be safer and have less of an impact on holistic health and well-being for many patients.Whilst the legislation has removed some barriers to service access, we know that addressing inequity for Māori, as well as other priority populations, requires new ways of thinking, otherwise we risk further embedding systemic inequity. Ministry data shows that Māori access abortion later than non-Māori, non-Pacific ethnicities. Whilst lack of services in regions with high Māori populations is a contributor, it is not the only cause of Māori inequity in abortion service access. In order to be accessible abortion services must meet the needs of communities requiring, but currently unable to access, services. Rangatahi Māori are a core group that must be engaged to support us meet this goal, along with Pacific youth, and Disabled people. In order for the full intent of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020 to be realised, there is the need to ensure there is an adequately trained workforce and accessible services that meet patient expectations across the entire abortion care patient journey.",

At Lotto NZ, providing a safe and secure gaming environment that encourages responsible play is central to our operations. Our games are intended to be fun and entertaining and should never be viewed as a means of relieving financial, personal or other difficulties. Due to the marked increase in the move towards online play, it is important that we adapt to changing player behaviour and enhance our responsible gaming approach to ensure that it is fit for purpose for online play. This is where the Behavioural Analytics Tool (‘BA Tool’/ ‘Solution’) comes in – it will support our focus on continuous improvement and enhance Lotto NZ’s ability to provide effective harm minimisation online that not only prevents excessive and potentially harmful play but informs players about their play behaviour. The addition of a Behavioural Analytics tool will play a key role for Lotto NZ to enable us to continue to meet our obligations of both maximising profit and minimising the potential for harm associated with our games.What we requireLotto NZ wants to utilise a Behavioural Analytics (BA) Tool that will provide us with information and insight into player behaviour. It is our intention that the BA Tool will equip Lotto NZ with the ability to inform players about their play behaviour while improving gambling literacy, and allow us to suppress marketing to players identified as playing in a potentially harmful way. Data we gather from the tool will also help inform our responsible gaming programme. To do this we are looking to use a tool that is based on the psychology of gambling. The BA Tool would complement our current responsible gaming programme, and provide Lotto NZ with analysis about player behaviour.

Despite a recent marked growth in our online channel, retail sales currently account for over 60% of total sales. The balance of total sales varies according to changes to our game portfolio, and fluctuations in our jackpot amounts. The object of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to seek a partner to execute the processing and printing of the thermal yellow paper, and the subsequent dispatch of the full order of prepacked cartons of stock to our   warehouses located in Auckland and Wellington.  This enables us to distribute stock to the  Lotto NZ retail network within set timeframes and in accordance with set standards of quality and accuracy. We supply the product at our cost to  retailers. Lotto NZ exists to exist to provide safe gaming that allows New Zealanders to play and win while contributing money back to New Zealand communities. With 100% of our profits going to the community, via the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board, we generate funding that supports the vital work of thousands of Kiwi organisations and charities every year.Therefore cost efficiency and the highest quality of production is paramount to us. Any errors in the printing or finishing of the product may lead to hardware malfunctions, and loss of sales. Should a production error occur, remediation and identification of faulty individual rolls can be extremely onerous. Lotto NZ is an iconic brand, with high visibility and awareness from the general public and our customers in the event of any perceived errors in our materials.  It is therefore vital that we achieve 100% production accuracy and quality through this contract. Lotto NZ tickets are produced for our draw-based games: Lotto, Strike, Powerball, Bullseye and Keno (see www.mylotto.co.nz for more information on game play). The yellow paper tickets are printed in store using terminals manufactured by International Game Technology PLC (IGT). Each retail outlet has at least one terminal and printer and associated hardware in the store.",

However in some locations in the South Island relatively high spatial overlap between dolphins and trawl fishing effort meant that trawl risk was not negligible, and in Mauī habitat there is a desire to ensure that residual risk effectively zero.  There is a need to better understand the way in which Hector’s dolphins interact with trawl vessels and fishing gear, to inform trawl risk mitigation options.  Currently there are trawl gear restrictions in place in some high-dolphin-density areas requiring that nets have a headline height less than 1 m, on the assumption that low-headline-height nets have a lower probability of capturing a dolphin.  This assumption is reasonable but the magnitude of any such effect on dolphin catchability has not been demonstrated empirically.  Other mitigation options may also prove useful, for example the use of real time proximity alarms, or acoustic deterrents to prevent dolphins from approaching or entering the net, but the effective design of any such options first requires that we understand how dolphins interact with the fishing gear, potentially leading to capture.",

As a result of the industry disruption caused by COVID-19, the Commonwealth notified industry of a 12 month delay to the release of the single-stage open tender approach to market (AusTender reference: JLC20-001-Notice1 published 26 May 20).After consultation with industry via an RFI (ATM ID: JLC20-001-RFI) the Commonwealth considers that risks inherent to an open tender for Global Freight and Customs Clearance Services can now be managed and that such a process is likely to result in a value for money procurement outcome. Accordingly, the Commonwealth plans to release a single-stage open tender approach to market via AusTender in the fourth quarter of FY 2020/2021 to replace the current GFF contract. An industry brief will be conducted in Melbourne shortly after the release of the open tender. The details in relation to the conduct of the industry brief will be included within the open tender.",

This assessment will factor in operational planning and management of risks, to strategically justify future investment required. While considering the strategic opportunities, the assessment needs to also identify potential immediate measures that could be the basis for investment.The Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions (DJPR), including Regional Development Victoria, is a key funding stakeholder with significant interest in the strategic direction for the project and is partnering with Parks Victoria to deliver this work.The concept plan and feasibility assessment for the Croajingalong Coastal Wilderness Walk project will holistically scope and market test a multiday experience. This should critically review activities that, combined, may form a ‘product’ such as hiking, canoeing, touring, and the setting of the Point Hicks Light Station. The feasibility assessment will identify the feasibility, market demand, business model and impact assessment for new experiences to determine a future operating model as a basis for further investment. Additionally, the project will identify a portion of early works that can be progressed to delivery stage, enabling part of the project to be ready to support Victoria’s economic recovery with further investment.",

With a catchment area outside of the Greater Geelong area that extends throughout south western Victoria, Barwon Health cares for a population in excess of 500,000. A broad spectrum of care is delivered, meeting the needs of the community at all stages of life and circumstance. The comprehensive range of services includes emergency and acute medicine, mental health, primary care, community services, residential aged care and sub-acute care and rehabilitation. Care is delivered across the region via a number of sites. The hospital precinct, dedicated primarily to acute care, education, training and research, encompasses the main University Hospital Geelong and immediate periphery locations in central Geelong. Sub-acute inpatient care and residential aged care is delivered from the McKellar Centre in North Geelong, with an additional residential aged care site in Charlemont. Community based care is delivered from numerous sites throughout the region, including in people’s homes. Barwon Health also operates from additional sites across the region to provide administrative services, providing support in the delivery of clinical care. There is high demand on health care services, driven by an increase in the size of the population, the ageing of the population, and the increase in the number of births each year. In 2018-19, Barwon Health reported 78,126 presentations at the Emergency Department, 21,847 operations and 87,004 inpatient separations. To support access and flow from bed based services, Barwon Health is seeking to partner with an agency, such as a supported residential service, for people transitioning out of hospital who are unable to live independently in the short term. The facility will only be used when there is a clear plan for returning home or to a bed based service for planned ongoing health care and/or rehabilitation.The aim of the service is to achieve a step down accommodation support service for patients deemed not suitable to be discharged home in the short term. The tender is being undertaken to improve the consumer experience, ensuring people are in the most appropriate care facility.",

Along with this, to achieve accreditation, the next piece of work must explore the supervision elements required for trainees on the VRGP to work towards their RG2 training goals and beyond.It is important to map out the supervision requirements of the multiple options doctors of different characteristics and interests might pursue at this stage. These include being part of the following programs that articulate with the RG career pathway: PEP, IP, ACRRM, RVTS, RACGP, RJDTIF, MDRAP and PMCV.Secondly, it is critical to identify what sort of PGY2 step can be used most effectively, where and why based on the chances of accreditation and delivering high quality training. This includes reviewing the current PMCV accreditation requirements for PGY2 and how they can be maximised with alternative supervision arrangements. This also somewhat depends on considering the qualifications of doctors working in these locations, their credentialed specialties and interests in supervising.Finally, it is important to explore the barriers and enablers to implementing the various pathways and supervision options, so as to achieve the desired training.This project will be in partnership and collaboration across the following three regions as identified by The Department of Health:  Lodden Mallee, South West and Hume Regions.",

    "description": "Please do not submit an electronic response via Tenders ACT. Information on how to participate in the market sounding can be found below.Market sounding: Next generation ticketing system for Transport Canberra Thank you for your interest in the market sounding for the ACT’s next generation public transport ticketing system.  We are seeking advice from ticketing and real time passenger information system venders to inform the procurement planning for transitioning to a future transport fare collection system to replace the existing Canberra MyWay (ticketing) and NXTBUS (RTPI) systems.This is an exciting opportunity for interested industry wanting to deliver a ticketing system that is flexible, innovative, and able to meet the needs of Canberra’s growing public transport network.This market sounding will inform the design of the final procurement approach due out to market in mid-2021.Market sounding will be open until close of business 14 May 2021. Project OverviewThe Australian Capital Territory (ACT) is a self-governed territory in the south east of Australia. The only city in the ACT is Canberra, the capital of Australia with an estimated population of 445,000 as at 2021.The ACT Government, through Transport Canberra, is seeking advice from ticketing and real time passenger information system venders to inform its procurement planning for transitioning to a future transport fare collection system to replace the existing Canberra MyWay (ticketing) and Nxtbus (RTPI) systems. Transport Canberra is planning an open tender process commencing Mid 2021 with the view to have an operational system for 2023. Any information that you supply will help to inform procurement planning. Current systemThe current Canberra MyWay ticketing system is a contactless card-based system deployed on approximately 450 Canberra buses and 13 Light rail stations (soon to be 14 stations). There are no gated stations in the Canberra public transport system. MyWay processes approximately 15.6 million paid transactions each year. The system provides contactless card-based smartcard system and paper tickets. MyWay cards have a high rate of market penetration with over 93 percent of adult trips paid for using a MyWay card.Characteristics of possible new systemNext generation ticketing is being delivered in many cities across the world and includes the use of easy to use, account-based technology that allows users to manage and pay for their travel from their mobile device or credit card. COVID-19 has provided Transport Canberra with a unique opportunity to accelerate a cashless ticketing system.  Given the forced implementation under the current pandemic environment we have revised the scope to remove the requirement for providers to accommodate cash transactions, allowing the Territory to move to 100% cashless public transport system as well as a future focussed cost effective state of the art ticketing solution.The envisioned system will support Transport Canberra’s multi modal transport network that includes bus and light rail. It is also planned to leverage MaaS (Mobility as a Service) opportunities to enhance connectivity and accessibility to a broad range of users included disadvantaged groups through platforms which enable integration with a range of other services, integrated and simpler journey planning, and more targeted service provision in the future.The procurement project will include replacement of the current back office with an account based, open architecture system and real time communications that facilitates open loop payments such as mobile ticketing and the use of credit / debit cards. The vendor will be required to provide core operational ticketing services over the service term and to supply tokens in an appropriate format.
